## Replicability of DWI Connectome-Based Brain-Wide Associations (BWAS)

### Overview

This project provides a comprehensive evaluation of the replicability of Brain-Wide Association Studies (BWAS) that are based on diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) measures. We investigated how consistently associations between various DWI-derived brain metrics (including streamline connectivity, fractional anisotropy, and other tensor metrics) and a wide range of behavioral phenotypes can be replicated in independent samples.

### Methods

* **Data:** Analyses utilized the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset (N up to 425 per discovery/replication split, across 58 phenotypes) and the AOMIC dataset (N up to 425, 19 phenotypes) for validating streamline connectivity (SC) models.
* **DWI Metrics:** We assessed replicability for streamline connectivity (SC), fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), axial diffusivity (AD), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC).
* **Replicability Criteria:** A stringent definition of replicability was used, requiring a model to achieve significant prediction (p<0.05) in an unseen replication sample in over 80% of data shuffles, given a significant discovery set model.

### Key Findings

* Overall, 36% (21 out of 58) of the studied phenotypes demonstrated replicable BWAS in the HCP dataset.
* Trait-like behavioral measures showed higher replicability (50%, 16/32) compared to state-like measures (19%, 5/26).
* Streamline connectivity (SC) based models were found to be the most economical, requiring smaller average discovery sample sizes (nâ‰ˆ171) and showing higher replicable effect sizes.
* SC models successfully replicated 42% of tested phenotypes in the AOMIC validation dataset.
* Exploratory analyses indicated that using higher-resolution atlases could potentially improve replicability.
* SHAP analyses on replicable models identified influential white matter tracts that significantly correlated with their target behavioral measures, underscoring the potential for interpretable DWI-based brain-behavior characterization.

### Implications & Future Directions

This work highlights the critical roles of sample size, choice of connectome/DWI metric, and the nature of the phenotype in achieving replicable DWI-based BWAS.
* For **trait-like phenotypes**, further robust analyses and validation in larger datasets are essential.
* For **state-like phenotypes**, pursuing higher sample sizes and integrating dynamic neuroimaging modalities (e.g., fMRI, EEG, MEG) could be highly beneficial for advancing our understanding, particularly in areas like mental health.
